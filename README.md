# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is basically tic tac toe inside tic tac toe or (tictactoe)^2. Each main square has inside it a seperate game of tic tac toe. The rules are you need to place your color inside one of the main squares where your opponent placed in the inner game. I made the game on a device i created myself and I have also another app on this device: the [https://github.com/greenslimestudios/rpn_calculator] rpn graphing calculator.
